      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely privileged to have worked with so many different people, in so many different contexts. Being exposed to such diversity has greatly benefited me and enriched my world view. But there&amp;rsquo;s also a little bit of everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve internalised - little tools, values and principles for which I am grateful.
You get to learn a lot about a person just by pairing with them on a technical problem or even collaborating on something more strategic1.</description>

      <description>The biggest critical failure that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced on a project happened on the first week of 2014 and caused a recurring outage that lasted a full four days.
It was my very first large-scale, distributed production system with multi-national integrations and a real-time messaging component. I had been on the project for 3 months and had inherited the tech lead role which I shared with a senior colleague who had joined after me.</description>

      <description>This was initially meant to be a technical post like I promised, but I was faced with several dilemmas:
 Any particular tech I write about will be obsolete by next Tuesday, the standard unit of time it takes for unlikely events to occur in computing.. There will always be much better resources elsewhere, because I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert in anything.  So instead of yet another tutorial on test-driven Ansible, Kafka or whatever the hottest web framework of the week, I present to you some great ideas that have a better shelf-life.</description>
