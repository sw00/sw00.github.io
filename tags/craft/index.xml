      <description>This was initially meant to be a technical post like I promised, but I was faced with several dilemmas:
 Any particular tech I write about will be obsolete by next Tuesday, the standard unit of time it takes for unlikely events to occur in computing.. There will always be much better resources elsewhere, because I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert in anything.  So instead of yet another tutorial on test-driven Ansible, Kafka or whatever the hottest web framework of the week, I present to you some great ideas that have a better shelf-life.</description>

      <description>Hello, world. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. There are some words that I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding on to that I&amp;rsquo;d like to set free. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been hiding somewhat and now taking some tentative steps back into the light. This is the first meager step. I have some more to follow. Please be gentle and patient with me.
For continuity, I&amp;rsquo;ve cross-posted my last public appearance here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a generalist. And this has served me well.</description>
