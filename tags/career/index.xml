      <description>Hello, world. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. There are some words that I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding on to that I&amp;rsquo;d like to set free. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been hiding somewhat and now taking some tentative steps back into the light. This is the first meager step. I have some more to follow. Please be gentle and patient with me.
For continuity, I&amp;rsquo;ve cross-posted my last public appearance here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a generalist. And this has served me well.</description>

      <description>This is a cross-post of my original Facebook note, announcing my decision to exit TW and tech to take a break.
San Antonio, Kampala, Porto Alegre, San Francisco, Nairobi, Johannesburg. These are the cities I have worked in during my time at ThoughtWorks (TW), that quirky (yet “elite”) global IT consultancy that Martin Fowler works for, little known outside of tech circles. Needless to say, I am the most privileged person I know.</description>
