      <description>This is the second part of a blog post in which I share four principles that I picked up from four different people I&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to have worked with.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely privileged to have worked with so many different people, in so many different contexts. Being exposed to such diversity has greatly benefited me and enriched my world view. But there&amp;rsquo;s also a little bit of everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve internalised - little tools, values and principles for which I am grateful.
You get to learn a lot about a person just by pairing with them on a technical problem or even collaborating on something more strategic1.</description>
