      <description>Hello, world. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. There are some words that I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding on to that I&amp;rsquo;d like to set free. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been hiding somewhat and now taking some tentative steps back into the light. This is the first meager step. I have some more to follow. Please be gentle and patient with me.
For continuity, I&amp;rsquo;ve cross-posted my last public appearance here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a generalist. And this has served me well.</description>
