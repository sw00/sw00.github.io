      <description>As with many people my age (27), I primarily started working and playing on computers when graphical user interfaces were already the norm and Windows 95 had just hit the peak of popularity. Unless your parents were engineers of some sort, personal computers were generally seen as just a new home appliance. If you had a computer in the 90s, it most likely was a Packard Bell that came with Windows 95 and Intel Pentium processor of some sort.</description>
