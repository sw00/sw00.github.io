    <h1 class="title">An Easter in POA</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I had finally arrived in Porto Alegre on Tuesday night after approximately a 16 hour trip(transit via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo-Guarulhos_International_Airport">GRU</a>). A quick 15 minute taxi ride took me to neighbourhood of Bom Fim, where I&rsquo;d be staying in a hotel until more permanent living arrangements were made. Marcelo, my cab driver was a helpful guy and offered a lot of advice and information about the city as we drove through it. I was too bewildered and tired to take note of any of it. I noticed main roads used a two way system with a bus lane in the middle. He apologised as we passed through some district where there was &ldquo;bad bars and prostitutes&rdquo; (as he put it).</p>

<p>Looking out upon the city skyline and streets in the day quickly dispelled all notions of the Brazil I&rsquo;d imagined from its portrayals in pop culture. I have worked with a few wonderful Brazilian colleagues in Johannesburg and  even though I knew that the colourful and gritty Brazil portrayed in the likes of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248/">City of God</a> is at best a caricature of only one city, there is always some romanticised attachment to the clichès and perspectives of the imagination.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IvB2rBBl.jpg" alt="POA Skyline from hotel elevator" />
<small>Lots of little apartment buildings in Bom Fim.</small></p>

<p>The city of Porto Alegre is situated in the state of Rio Grande du Sol (Big River of the South) and is known for having a very European vibe to it. There are still lot of old buildings down town though most of them are left as facades for parking or some other modern use behind.</p>

<p>The streets look clean to me but for the abundance of graffiti ranging from small murals to more common &ldquo;tags&rdquo;. You will not find the grit and chaos of Bree street here<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. You will instead find giant, ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacaranda">Jacaranda</a> trees covered in beautiful vines. Which totally messed with my perception of where I am since I grew up in the <a href="http://showme.co.za/pretoria/tourism/the-jacaranda-city/">Jacaranda City</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/K1StkTil.jpg" alt="Giant Jacarandas in POA" />
<small>Wait, am I back home?</small></p>

<p>To be quite honest I do not know much of the history of Brazil, let alone Porto Alegre (POA for short) but I hope to discover more in my year-long adventure here. It&rsquo;s one of the lesser known cities despite having hosted a world cup match<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. I had in fact not heard of it before meeting coworkers who hailed from there.</p>

<p>What I did find out is that it&rsquo;s right next a big river that makes it <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/@-30.0503783,-51.1901651,11z?hl=en">look like a bay</a> in Google Maps. And then I found out the the river I was looking at is actually a <a href="https://www.google.com.br/maps/@-30.5023817,-51.1357736,9z?hl=en">small part of a HUGE river</a>. POA is situated on the edge of fractal!! And &ldquo;Big River of the South&rdquo; needs a better name like &ldquo;MASSIVE river of the South&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rio Godzilla du Sol&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/W9yTSP9l.png" alt="Map of Porto Alegre" />
<small>Cool, it&rsquo;s a bay!</small></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5CaqxVMl.png" alt="Map of Porto Alegre zoomed out" title="Rio Godzilla du Sol" />
<small>Oh. Hang on&hellip;</small></p>

<p>POA&rsquo;s <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Porto_Alegre">WikiTravel</a> page is shorter than most destinations, its biggest feature being its parks. And boy, are the parks plentiful and beautiful. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farroupilha_Park">Parque Farroupilha</a> was a short walking distance away from our hotel so my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/amukizaa">Andrew</a> and I decided to brave a walk and maybe get some lunch on the way. It turns out this is a difficult thing to do on Good Friday since all the usual restaurants are closed and we don&rsquo;t speak Portuguese. We settled on some hot dog &ldquo;especial&rdquo; from a food truck next to the park and much awkard gesturing and sheepish &ldquo;sim&rdquo;s and &ldquo;obrigados&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. It was more than a hot dog, the man layered a dozen sauces and stuff on top of it such that it could pass as modern art. And it was delicious.</p>

<p>But enough of this deliberation, have some photos from that walk:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UDk2BIil.jpg" alt="Awesome mural painting on what's presumably a hot dog and chips joint when it's open." title="Fast food surrealism!" />
<small>When fast food attacks!</small></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HfeE8myl.jpg" alt="Posters for an anti capitalism protest" title="Anti Capitalismo Protest!" />
<small>Anti Capitalismo Proteste! I like this place already.</small></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1mCW6Swl.jpg" alt="Abacaxi truck" />
<small>Abacaxi is the &ldquo;cellar door&rdquo; of the Portuguese language, except it actually makes sense.</small></p>

<small>Tortoise and Swan.</small></p>

<p>The next day we enlisted the help our Bolivian colleague who had been living in POA for around 3 years now. She knew the area and Portuguese (although she says it&rsquo;s difficult, being a native Spanish speaker herself<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>). We went back to the Parque Farroupilha for a longer walk without the edge of not being able to communicate and then we went down town to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre_Public_Market">Mercado Público</a>, a big old building in the city centre with dozens of stalls selling stuff from curios to meat and cheese. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t snap any pictures from there.</p>

<p>After that we went to Praça da Alfândega nearby which had MARGS (Museum of Art) near it. Now MARGS is free to enter and has a permanent collection with some peripharel exhibitions sometimes. It had a lot contemporary pieces but the most amazing work I saw was the painting below.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5VYtrrQl.jpg" alt="&quot;Emigrante&quot; painting" /></p>

<p>It is a portrait of an immigrant by a Napoleone Grady, an Italian artist, painted in 1887. Every now and then you see a painting that has some ineffable, metaphysical property - you can swear by it. This was one of those. Looking at it for a few moments, you could hear the waves in the background and the same impossible light that you find in Rembrandt&rsquo;s paintings illuminating the lady. I would definitely like to go back and view it again.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Sunday, to contrast the previous day&rsquo;s high cultural experiences I joined some of my new colleagues who were attending an Anime convention. I don&rsquo;t think it needs much explanation than the photos below.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l3BhYHAl.jpg" alt="Crowd inside Anime Convention" />
<small>More cosplayers than casuals.</small></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y7QqR3ol.jpg" alt="Excellent costume" />
<small>Award winning costume.</small></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sDJVrAKl.jpg" alt="Girls with big guns" />
<small>Obligatory girls with big guns who later turned out to be the judges of the cosplay competition.</small></p>

<p>The anime enthusiasts, geeks, nerds etc&hellip; in POA seem to take cosplay very seriously, as evidenced by the quality of costumes and props. What struck me is that despite being a relatively small convention (I estimate only about 500 people there), there were more people dressed in costume than not.</p>

<p>Overall, my first weekend in Brazil has been very surprising and a lot of fun. I&rsquo;m currently trying to learn more Portuguese and enjoying my time here. Happy belated Easter!</p>

<li id="fn:1">Bree street is in Johannesburgs&rsquo; CBD (Central Building District, or Downtown) and has a very post-apocalyptic feeling to it because of it&rsquo;s crumbling, abandoned buildings and trash everywhere. I drove through it at night a few times and navigating it is difficult, often having to avoid the odd piece of furniture on the road and disorganised side streets.
