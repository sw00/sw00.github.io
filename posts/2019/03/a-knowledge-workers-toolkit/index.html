<p>Knowledge work can have some pretty tricky characteristics that renders it
distinct from physical work. For one, it defies quantification. While chefs,
carpenters and other tradespeople can see their efforts take shape into
concrete, material output, the knowledge worker is not so fortunate.</p>

<p>Our raw materials are intangible - what tools could we use to manipulate them?
Likewise, our output can seem quite ephemeral - did the thing we produced
actually add value, by what measure<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:value"><a href="#fn:value">1</a></sup>? Worst of all, our effort<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:effort"><a href="#fn:effort">2</a></sup>
is elastic and difficult to wield in a consistent and predictable way.  Effort
spent does not always translate into value extracted. Often something as
nebulous as a change of perspective can yield great benefits in orders of
magnitude, but other times stutter and struggle for days to achieve a
basic goal<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:parkinsons"><a href="#fn:parkinsons">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Despair. How are we to cope with this and take control of our own faculties?
What tools can we build to apply to our problems? By applying a little
metacognition (thinking about how we&rsquo;re thinking), we can be a bit more
deliberate and perhaps obtain some tools for thought.</p>

<h1 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h1>

<p>Arguably the closests thing to tools we have are the mental models we employ
when working on a task. This is true is the most general sense, from changing a
tyre to analysing a dataset. We&rsquo;re always using an abstraction to make sense of
the world and help us to make decisions that will give us the outcome we want.
Success depends greatly on how closely the mental model we employ corresponds
to the external world.</p>

<p>All models have limitations, however. They&rsquo;re always bounded approximations
since we&rsquo;re only human and not omiscient: we can&rsquo;t keep the full description of
the universe in our heads. So it&rsquo;s useful to be aware of the limitations and
assumptions of the model we&rsquo;re using. Find the boundaries, so to speak, and we
may expose our own biases.</p>

<h2 id="bias">Bias</h2>

<p>Bias in this case is the tendency for a mental model to favour certain outcomes
when applied in a context. I don&rsquo;t think this is categorically bad, as we&rsquo;re
led to believe.</p>

<p>To reason about this, I like to think of the oft-cited quote by George
Box<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:box"><a href="#fn:box">4</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All models are wrong but some are useful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A cleaver is great at chopping meat but perhaps rather unwieldy for peeling
potatoes. This is because a cleaver has the characteristic of being large and
weighty, with a flat blade edge well suited for a chopping motion. It lacks the
small, sharp, angled blade that is more suited to slicing and peeling.</p>

<p>We can analyse mental models in the same way we do with real tools. But first
it may be useful to say that they all exhibit at least two types of properties.
Ones that are <em>direct</em> and <em>intentional</em> (by design), but also some properties that
are <em>unintentional</em> and <em>emergent</em>.</p>

<p>For example, using a metaphor of building construction to frame how software is
created immediately brings us to think about it as a <em>sequential</em> process. One in
which we lay blocks upon blocks of foundations until we complete a structure.
The unintentional consquence of this model is that it hides the relationship
between local and global components. Even worse, the metaphor offers no helpful
description of how the software might behave. Its bias is the assumption that
the whole is merely the sum of its parts that obfuscates other aspects that
may be important.</p>

<h2 id="some-characteristics-of-models">Some Characteristics of Models</h2>

<p>In order to be more mindful of the mental models we&rsquo;re using, it&rsquo;s useful to
know some qualities we may want to evaluate them against<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:context"><a href="#fn:context">5</a></sup>. I&rsquo;ve often
used the following to try and explore a problem space:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Precision</strong>: does the model have a quality of precision that can be
tweaked?  Does precision mean being being more specific (semantics) or purely
in the mathematical/quantitative sense?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Fidelity</strong>: is there a threshold of quality we can increase/decrease to
different things noticable?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Topology</strong>: is distance and connectedness important aspects of the model?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Boundaries</strong>: are there any delineations between things? Are they strong or
porous?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Temporality</strong>: does time play a central role in interactions? Are events
sequential or asynchronous?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Directionality</strong>: is there a direction in which things go important?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Authorship</strong>: do we have direct control on the outcome or can we merely
direct it by manipulating second-order things?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Economics</strong>: is it useful to introduce an element of cost? What should be
made cheaper or more expensive?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Relational</strong>: are there traits that make certain things belong together or
interact? Are they fuzzy and probabilistic, or concrete and deterministic?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some general things that may be useful to think about when
approaching a problem. They are incomplete and this is not an exhaustive list
but I&rsquo;ve often found some of them helpful when applied prudently in
problem-solving.  In future posts, I hope to expand on specific models that
I&rsquo;ve used to make sense of phenomena I&rsquo;ve encountered in software development.
Hopefully, they will useful or at least entertaining to explore.</p>
