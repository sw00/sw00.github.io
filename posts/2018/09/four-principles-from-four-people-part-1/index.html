    <h1 class="title">Four principles from four people (part 1)</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      

<p>I&rsquo;ve been extremely privileged to have worked with so many different people, in so
many different contexts. Being exposed to such diversity has greatly benefited
me and enriched my world view. But there&rsquo;s also a little bit of everyone I&rsquo;ve
internalised - little tools, values and principles for which I am grateful.</p>

<p>You get to learn a lot about a person just by pairing with
them on a technical problem or even collaborating on something more
strategic<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:euphemism"><a href="#fn:euphemism">1</a></sup>. You experience their idiosyncracies and philosophy. And
in doing so, a little bit of your own idiosyncracies surface, like looking into
the proverbial &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to share four principles I picked up from four people that have had
tremendous impact on me and how I approach work. Here below, I&rsquo;ll introduce the
first two.</p>

<h1 id="go-fast">Go fast</h1>

<p>Embodied by a certain ridiculously charismatic, Irish-American developer who
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of using some cusswords to get his point across<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:cussing"><a href="#fn:cussing">2</a></sup>, from
whom I learnt pretty much most of everything I know now. Although this
principle was not stated so explicitly, upon reflection I realised a lot of my
own approaches to software development has been deeply influenced if not learnt
directly from him. Let&rsquo;s see if I can lay out the main ideas below:</p>

<p><strong>Adopt a bias for action</strong>. Not every decision the same impact, so minimise
its cost and overhead. It&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable (and fun) to play
rock-paper-scissors with your pair to make low-impact decisions. This blew my
mind the first time. But I&rsquo;ve used this often, though people sometimes find it
unnerving that I make some tech decisions by chance.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the thinking behind this? Well, a lot of details in software development
are indeed trivial from a larger perspective. Which test runner should we use?
What should I really name this function? Who cares, they both have minimal
impact <em>and</em> cost little to change. Another thing to understand is that when
starting a new project, feature or change you will be at the <em>highest level of
ignorance</em> such that you might not have the right understanding to competently
choose one over the other: a random choice is just as good as an ignorant
choice.</p>

<p>When framed this way, it follows that even making the wrong choice is valuable
because it will reduce your level of ignorance. The trick is reducing the
impact of wrong choices so you&rsquo;re free to make mistakes for learning. There are
techniques and practices you can adopt to achieve this and it&rsquo;s pretty much
what all Agile, Continuous Delivery, Lean and DevOps is about in principle.</p>

<p><strong>Make feedback a first-class citizen</strong>. Invest heavily in the things that will
give you the right level of information very quickly. On technical level, this
means Test-Driven Development and Automation. Ask yourself: what is the
expected impact of this decision and how do I verify it? Write that automated
test, make friends with your testers and users, push for read access to
environments, send those emails to other teams and managers. This applies to
meta-decisions too: retrospectives and one-on-one sessions create a feedback
loop for how you&rsquo;re working as a team.</p>

<p><strong>Leverage the last responsible moment</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:lrm"><a href="#fn:lrm">3</a></sup>. You will always have more or
higher grade of information later in time than you do right now. Given this,
your best bet at making an informed decision is later, so all decisions that
can be deferred should be. Seems simple, but I&rsquo;ve found the difficulty is
actuall in deciding whether you can afford to defer it. Two things are helpful
in this regard: divide-and-conquer and maximising options.</p>

<p>The first approach is about investigating whether you can break the decision
down into smaller, low-impact ones. For example, what if you simply load the
data from a flat text file in memory for now instead of committing to a
particular database? The second approach is about making the choices that will
yield you more options. In a way this is closely related to the
divide-and-conquer approach too because the former will likely yield more
options anyway.</p>

<h1 id="go-slow">Go slow</h1>

<p>There are very few people who are so brilliant and smart that they consistently
and effortlessly outperform everyone else. Give a smart person a task and they
will complete it to perfect specification in very little time. But rarer yet
are people who seem to possess innate wisdom and endless compassion. The
following principle I learnt from someone who embodies the latter, who I
consider a role model and had the tremendous privilege of being mentored by at
first, but then in more official terms as my boss.</p>

<p>To be precise, the principle is better stated: <strong>go as slow as you need to</strong>.
Though it may seem in contradiction to the first principle, it&rsquo;s actually quite
complementary.</p>

<p>Tasks, goals, missions, objectives. They suffer from a certain effect: that
once they are explicitly declared, they collapse the problem space and
obfuscate the <em>a priori</em> assumptions that were necessary to produce them.</p>

<p>There are always numerous ways to tackle a problem. One way is to solve the
immediate, first-order situation that you&rsquo;re presented with: if a building&rsquo;s on
fire, use the buckets you have to put it out.</p>

<p>An alternative is to take a step back and consider the context and processes
that led to its emergence: the building is on fire, rebuild it with
fire-resistant material or better yet, move it out of the volcano it&rsquo;s in.</p>

<p>This requires a deeper wisdom and discipline than the first-order &ldquo;task&rdquo;
oriented thinking<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:task"><a href="#fn:task">4</a></sup>. It is worth taking a detour and spending the time to
consider and work out a strategy to tackling these second-order problems. The
kicker here is that <em>learning a problem takes time to struggle with it</em>.
Something I didn&rsquo;t quite grok for ages because my de facto urge is feeling
pressured to get the result as quickly as possible when presented with a
challenge<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:frustration"><a href="#fn:frustration">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What does this actually look like in real life? It means, spending the time to
set up Continuous Delivery and path to production<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:path"><a href="#fn:path">6</a></sup> right (including the
time it takes you to learn it). Or putting in effort to position a solid
proposal for project that gives value not just to the client, but to the people
working on it too. It means taking some longer detours to build some
second-order tools to help you produce the first-order thing in higher quality,
but faster later.</p>

<p>Learn that new technique, fail and master it. Didn&rsquo;t meet your sprint
commitments? There&rsquo;s always next sprint, really. If something needs to
absolutely be done, then trust that it will need to get done. If not now then
later, armed with better understanding and more mastery.</p>

<p>There is tremendous value in going slow.</p>
