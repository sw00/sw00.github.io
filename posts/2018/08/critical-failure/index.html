    <div class="content">
      

<p>The biggest critical failure that I&rsquo;ve ever experienced on a project happened
on the first week of 2014 and caused a recurring outage that lasted a full four
days.</p>

<p>It was my very first large-scale, distributed production system with
multi-national integrations and a real-time messaging component.  I had been on
the project for 3 months and had inherited the tech lead role which I shared
with a senior colleague who had joined after me. Suffice to say we lost a
lifetime&rsquo;s worth of sleep that week.</p>

<p>The project itself was replete with problems.  In spite of the excellent
technical foundations the original tech leads had laid, the core web
application had been eroded into a (well-tested) ball of mud<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:mud"><a href="#fn:mud">1</a></sup> and for
various legitimate reasons nobody understood the current runtime architecture
or how it got deployed to production<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:automation"><a href="#fn:automation">2</a></sup>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy,
duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle. These systems show
unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient
repair.&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:mud"><a href="#fn:mud">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our client, the product owner, had been using us to bootstrap his startup and
was aggressively chasing growth (i.e. features) without any reprieve for almost
2 years<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:agile"><a href="#fn:agile">3</a></sup>. All while leveraging a relatively inexperienced team that
suffered high attrition, unhealthy levels of priority and context-switching,
breaks in project continuity and working in a highly sophisticated tech stack
nobody had any significant experience in<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:nonprofit"><a href="#fn:nonprofit">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There was a lot of firefighting and the problems seemed serious enough that I
was absolutely terrified of not being able to cope. So armed with a rigorous
report of about two dozen urgent &ldquo;tech debt&rdquo; items, I recommended a complete
feature freeze as my first act as tech lead. Alas, greatness is not achieved by
capitulating to the demands of harsh reality, so feature development was (of
course) prioritised above all else.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgflip.com/1rojys.jpg#c" alt="Scotty from Star Trek" /></p>

<p>It was in this context that we were faced with a spectacular outage. While
certainly not ideal, the journey to finding the root cause was not without
some personal cognitive failures (jumping to conclusions is best done in an
excited panic).</p>

<h1 id="the-technical-details">The technical details</h1>

<p>The central part of the system was a few message broker(worker) processes that
would respond directly to incoming user messages fast as possible<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:brokers"><a href="#fn:brokers">5</a></sup>. In
practice this was a bunch of Celery workers subscribed to queues on a RabbitMQ
cluster and acting on data lookups to a MongoDB cluster. Because there was some
business logic they needed to leverage, the workers lived in the same
repository as the Django web application to keep things DRY. There was actually
more than one type of worker and they were differentiated by means of <a href="https://12factor.net/config" target="_blank">injected
configuration</a>. These workers were failing to
reply to incoming messages and we didn&rsquo;t know why. It was a highly critical
problem, and in certain cases could lead to a potential life-and-death
situation. No pressure.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any issue in staging and we hadn&rsquo;t deployed in the past two
weeks. It was also clear that the usual approaches to debugging<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:debugging"><a href="#fn:debugging">6</a></sup>
could not be applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>Production was orders of magnitude larger than staging (thanks MongoDB and
&ldquo;big&rdquo; data)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it had almost reached the 300GB upper bound of the Linode disk we had
provisioned for it. For testing, we had a job regularly sync a small subset of
records from the production cluster to the much smaller staging instances.</p>

<ul>
<li>We couldn&rsquo;t be sure what production actually looked like versus what it was
meant to look like.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a collection of Puppet manifests and roles that were mostly
inscrutable due to my lack of experience with its Ruby-esque DSL and best
practices hadn&rsquo;t quite emerged yet <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:puppet"><a href="#fn:puppet">7</a></sup>. Also we didn&rsquo;t know when last the
scripts had been run and (to my abject horror) I found lots of dead code and
traces of orphaned configuration on some of the servers themselves. This was
also before the advent of docker and immutable, phoenix servers. In fact it was
everybody&rsquo;s first signficant exposure to Infrastructure as Code<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:iac"><a href="#fn:iac">8</a></sup>,
including my own<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:impostor"><a href="#fn:impostor">9</a></sup>.</p>

<h1 id="assume-the-assumption-pose">Assume the assumption pose</h1>

<p>So what could be done? Of course, I thought, this is exactly what automated
build &amp; deployment pipelines are for and promptly redeployed the latest trunk
to production. It seemed to resolve the issue, we could see the messages being
picked up and responded to...at least until the afternoon when it stubbornly
reappeared. And so the pattern would repeat: deploy, fixed, broken again,
deploy, fixed, broken again. The definition of insanity.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the day, mild panic had set in. We reviewed the brokers&rsquo; code
over and over, ran some production data through staging and observed the output
by logs and queries to Mongo. I dreaded the seemingly inevitable realisation
that something was wrong with the infrastructure itself. Perhaps the Linode, or
even the way RabbitMQ is configured causing an edge case bug to appear (the two
most opaque parts of the system for all of us).</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep much that night and spent most of it reading up on everything I
possibly could on message queues and brokers. I also looked through RabbitMQ&rsquo;s
mailing lists and issues looking for a mention of similar symptoms and in the
hopes of finding a quick fix. Stackoverflow posts were made. And at some point
I even logged into the Freenode IRC chatroom to ask for assistance.</p>

<p>Day two came around and it was clear to me that we had to pursue the nuclear
option: we needed to rebuild production. This entailed provisioning new Linode
machines and running the dubious Puppet scripts against them, then carefully
teasing apart each Linode box and reconstituting them into the new clusters. I
was also  wary of copying the problem over to the new environment so it was a
manual process of educated <em>guesswork</em> and <em>intuition</em>, by poor developers with
the minimal experience in system adminstration. There is no universe in which
this is an even remotely pleasant experience, but we were forced to learn the
system&rsquo;s run state configuration quite intimately and make best-effort
decisions where there were gaps and ambiguities...</p>

<h1 id="it-follows">It follows.</h1>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember all of it, but I believe this took us the next whole day and
half. And it was unsuccessful. To my complete disbelief, the issue had managed
to follow us into a fresh environment. I was too tired to even despair and
mulled over the terrible consequences to come. I mentally prepared myself to
the reality that this might cause the client&rsquo;s company to collapse and I might
be losing my job<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:job"><a href="#fn:job">10</a></sup>. Or so it goes.</p>

<p>Then, as I tried eat my lunch with a dry mouth, fatigued, my thoughts wandered
to something I had seen in the codebase during the whole ordeal. Some of the
Celery workers were set to operate on a timer to complete <em>recurring</em> tasks
instead of responding to messages. The purpose of these tasks was to generate
reports from MongoDB records and they were set to run every 5 minutes to
provide close-to real-time statistics. But why couldn&rsquo;t they be in realtime?</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>The dots finally connected and coalesced into a single phrase I may have muttererd out loud: &ldquo;fuck you, map reduce.&rdquo;</p>

<h1 id="two-facts-two-implications-one-conclusion">Two facts, two implications, one conclusion</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Celery uses a backend broker to consume messages <em>and</em> schedule tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>This means a worker with a scheduled, recurring task is not just a
consumer, but pushes messages on to RabbitMQ.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>The processing of reports is a long-running MapReduce across all records in
the most populous MongoDB collection.</p>

<ul>
<li>This collection has been growing at a linear rate since the project&rsquo;s first
deployment and so too would its running time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conlusion</strong>: The time it took to run the reports had overtaken the scheduling
period. The natural consequence of this was that on average, more tasks were
being created than completed so over time the possibility of completing tasks
trended toward zero.</p>

<h1 id="the-solution">The solution</h1>

<p>The immediate fix was trivial. Increase the scheduled period to
be much longer than the time it takes to run the report. However, this was also
a result of a flaw in our configuration there was no separation of concerns
reflected in our RabbitMQ setup. It might have been an acceptable shortcut to
have all brokers share the same queues in the beginning, but it wasn&rsquo;t any
longer. Lesson learnt, we gave the long-running workers their own queues.</p>

<p>But this only kicks the can down the road a little further. The complete
solution was to to refactor the mapreduce code to operate on a rolling window
of the records instead of the entire collection. Something I will never forget
now whenever I&rsquo;m  writing report-generating code.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-meta-solution">The meta-solution</h1>

<p>The issue and its solution seems quite arbitrary in retrospect. Any dev better
versed in RabbitMQ and Celery would have gleaned the problem immediately by
inspecting the RabbitMQ admin console and its queues. But I wondered if we
could&rsquo;ve done better and how I could avoid dead-ends.</p>

<p>It turns out we can. It&rsquo;s all about being a little more rigorous and explicit
with our assumptions. Doing so exposes our biases when debugging and
troubleshooting an issue.  If we felt like overachieving, it may also be
helpful to slow down and actually write down:</p>

<ol>
<li>the behaviour we&rsquo;re seeing</li>
<li>its potential causes</li>
<li>a list of hypotheses (along with observable behaviour that would falsify
them)</li>
</ol>

<p>Godmode would of course be writing this all in <em>first-order predicate calculus</em>
and you&rsquo;d certainly make Djikstra proud. But having a general grasp of it
should be good enough.</p>

<p>There is however an extremely important idea that has helped me in my
thinking: the difference between <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficient</em> conditions.</p>

<h1 id="the-mechanics-of-causality">The mechanics of causality</h1>

<p>In logic there is a notion of <em>implication</em>, which for our intents and purposes
can be regarded as analogous to causality<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:causality"><a href="#fn:causality">11</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s often denoted with an arrow like so: <span class="jsonly">
                  
        \(\rightarrow{}\)
    
</span>
<noscript>
                  
        <img style="display:inline;vertical-align:middle;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\inline&space;%5crightarrow%7b%7d" title="\rightarrow{}" />
    
</noscript>
</p>

<p>If we want to describe a scenario when a condition <em>A</em> holds then condition
<em>B</em> also holds (that is if <em>A</em> is true then <em>B</em> is also true), it can be
said that <em>A</em> <em>implies</em> <em>B</em> and denoted as follows:</p>

<p><span class="jsonly">
     
        $$A \rightarrow B$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?A%20%5crightarrow%20B" title="A \rightarrow B" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$antecedent \rightarrow consequent$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?antecedent%20%5crightarrow%20consequent" title="antecedent \rightarrow consequent" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>
</p>

<p>So one of the assumptions I had made implicitly can be denoted as follows:</p>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$\text{There is a bug in RabbitMQ} \rightarrow{} \text{Workers are failing to consume messages}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5ctext%7bThere%20is%20a%20bug%20in%20RabbitMQ%7d%20%5crightarrow%7b%7d%20%5ctext%7bWorkers%20are%20failing%20to%20consume%20messages%7d" title="\text{There is a bug in RabbitMQ} \rightarrow{} \text{Workers are failing to consume messages}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>


<p>This implication does hold. But we know that this wasn&rsquo;t the root cause. So what was my logical error? Say we reversed the implication:</p>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$\text{Workers are failing to consume messages} \rightarrow{} \text{There is a bug in RabbitMQ}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5ctext%7bWorkers%20are%20failing%20to%20consume%20messages%7d%20%5crightarrow%7b%7d%20%5ctext%7bThere%20is%20a%20bug%20in%20RabbitMQ%7d" title="\text{Workers are failing to consume messages} \rightarrow{} \text{There is a bug in RabbitMQ}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>


<p>Now that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite correct does it? This is because implication is a <strong>one way</strong> street.
There can be many reasons why workers are failing and a bug in RabbitMQ could be one of them, but whenever workers fail to consume messages it does not always <em>imply</em> that is a bug in RabbitMQ. This is the notion of <strong>sufficiency</strong>: <em>A</em> is <strong>sufficient</strong> for <em>B</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>B</em> also implies <em>A</em>.</p>

<p>Another relation is that of <strong>neccessity</strong>. It&rsquo;s a bit trickier because of the way the word is used in natural language. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$\text{The server is reachable} \rightarrow{} \text{The system is working correctly}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5ctext%7bThe%20server%20is%20reachable%7d%20%5crightarrow%7b%7d%20%5ctext%7bThe%20system%20is%20working%20correctly%7d" title="\text{The server is reachable} \rightarrow{} \text{The system is working correctly}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>


<p>Stated here, being able to reach the server is neither necessary nor sufficient condition for the system to be working correctly. However if we reversed the relation it works out. We can say that a the server being reachable is <em>necessary</em> for the system to be working (I like to reverse the arrow instead of swapping the terms in this case because it helps me reason about it better).</p>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$\text{The server is reachable} \leftarrow{} \text{The system is working correctly}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5ctext%7bThe%20server%20is%20reachable%7d%20%5cleftarrow%7b%7d%20%5ctext%7bThe%20system%20is%20working%20correctly%7d" title="\text{The server is reachable} \leftarrow{} \text{The system is working correctly}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>


<p>Confused? Yeah, me too most of the time. The final idea is that a condition <em>A</em> is both <strong>necessary</strong> and <strong>sufficient</strong> for <em>B</em> if that is the only property that implies <em>B</em>. This is the strongest implication and holds both ways, exclusively.</p>

<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$\text{The same input produces the same output} \Leftrightarrow{} \text{The system is deterministic}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5ctext%7bThe%20same%20input%20produces%20the%20same%20output%7d%20%5cLeftrightarrow%7b%7d%20%5ctext%7bThe%20system%20is%20deterministic%7d" title="\text{The same input produces the same output} \Leftrightarrow{} \text{The system is deterministic}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>


<p>A deterministic system is <strong>necessary</strong> for the same inputs to produce the same outputs. However, if we negate the one condition then the other condition must also be negated for the to hold: if the same input doesn&rsquo;t produce the same output, then the system isn&rsquo;t deterministic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d encourage you to look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency#Definitions" target="_blank">truth table</a> on Wikpedia to grok these concepts a little better. I keep having to revisit them myself.</p>

<h1 id="fin">Fin</h1>

<p>In a lot of ways, this post has been years in the making. I&rsquo;ve kept bits and
pieces of this written and scattered around. The experience sticks out as one
of those career defining moments where you completely get your ass kicked and
come out a completely changed person. That said, I&rsquo;ve definitely had many more
failures<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:failure"><a href="#fn:failure">12</a></sup> than successes and will probably have many more. I suspect
that everyone else has too - we just don&rsquo;t share them enough.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I was finally compelled to complete this post when a smart friend
shared her <a href="https://medium.com/@alienelf/how-solve-a-hard-bug-617874a28326" target="_blank">bug-solving
experiences</a>
(go <a href="https://twitter.com/alienelf" target="_blank">follow her</a>, she&rsquo;s cool). Along with that
Tesla worker posting about their <a href="https://twitter.com/atomicthumbs/status/1032939617404645376" target="_blank">technical
troubles</a>, it
seems critical failures are more prevalent than we may think. There are
no perfect projects, or teams but I hope this adds to the discourse in a meaningful way.</p>

 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:mud"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:automation">The dark side to automation is that it reduces the need for humans to understand what&rsquo;s under the hood. There was a fully automated build and deploy pipeline and infrastructure defined in Puppet that nobody dared to touch for lack of expertise.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:automation"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:agile">Unfortunately, they&rsquo;d also been bitten with the Agile bug in the wrong way and seemed to think that it meant no process and spontaneous changing of priorities.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:agile"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:nonprofit">The work was originally billed as non-profit, social impact which has a tendency to be viewed as trivial and thus staffed accordingly. Ironically, it was actually the most technically sophisticated project I&rsquo;ve ever worked on in some respects.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:nonprofit"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:brokers">At its peak, this could be up to 400 messages a minute, serviced by 2-4 worker processes.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:brokers"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:debugging">Try to replicate the problem in another environment, then poke and prod until you find the cause.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:debugging"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:puppet">For the record, Puppet is my least favourite Config Management tool even years later.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:puppet"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:iac">Declaring your infrastructure in code so that it can be built and tested automatically just like your application software. There&rsquo;s a whole set of principles and practices to this but think Puppet, Chef, Ansible and you&rsquo;re on the right track.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:iac"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:impostor">Compound this with the fact that I had only just learnt what a message broker even is and had only dealt with NoSQL document data stores in theory. I was a hot mess of self-doubt and (well-justified) impostor syndrome.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:impostor"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:job">An absurd thought in retrospect, but I&rsquo;ve had many such times over the years.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:job"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:causality">Be careful though, it&rsquo;s really not the <a href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/24170/causality-vs-implication" target="_blank">same thing</a>.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:causality"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:failure">Like the one time I introduced a bug by refactoring someone else&rsquo;s story which halted an entire release on a massive 7+ dev squad project. Or when I pushed up private source code to my personal github in the same week that someone else got fired for the same thing.
